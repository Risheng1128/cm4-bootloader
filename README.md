```
An experimental bootloader implementation on ARM Cortex-M4 processor.
- Device: [NUCLEO-F303ZE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f303ze.html)

## Build
`cm4-bootloader` dependents on some third-party packages to build code and burn into processor like [ARM GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) and [stlink](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink). Therefore, before using the project, we need to install these packages.

Install [ARM GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain):
```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

Install [stlink](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink):
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install git cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink && cd stlink
$ cmake .
$ make
$ cd bin && sudo cp st-* /usr/local/bin
$ cd ../lib && sudo cp *.so* /lib32
$ cd ../config/udev/rules.d/ && sudo cp 49-stlinkv* /etc/udev/rules.d/
```

Install [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/):
```shell
$ sudo apt install openocd
```

Build `cm4-bootloader`. It will compile bootloader and application respectively.
```shell
$ make
```

Burn the code into processor:
```shell
$ make upload
```

Execute the host program:
```shell
$ make host
```

## Debug
In `cm4-bootloader`, it uses [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/) to open the debug mode of processor. We can use the following command:
```shell
$ make debug
```

After typing the command, the next step is opening gdb to connect to rhe openocd.
```shell
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb
```

Connect to the openocd:
```shell
$ target remote localhost:3333
```

## Memory layout
In `cm4-bootloader`, the memory layout is shown as follows:
```
+--------------+ 0x08000000
|              |
|  Bootloader  |
|              |
+--------------+ 0x08004000
|              |
|  Application |
|              |
+--------------+
```

## Communicate with host
`cm4-bootloader` uses USART to send and receive data. The following picture shows how bootloader to communicate with host.
1. Host sends the command package to bootloader.
2. Bootloader receives the package and reply ACK or NACK to host based on cyclic redundancy check (CRC). If bootloader sends ACK, then it will send the length of reply data.
3. Finally, bootloader sends the reply data if it sends ACK at previous step. That is, the communication will stop if bootloader sends NACK.
```
 host                       bootloader
   |                             |
   |     1. command package      |
   | --------------------------> |
   |                             |
   |         2. ACK/NACK         |
   | <-------------------------- |
   |                             |
   |        3. reply data        |
   | <-------------------------- |
   |                             |
```

### Command package format
The following picture shows the command package format.
1. Command code defined at [bootloader.c](./bl/bootloader.c) uses to check the current command and its size is 1 byte.
2. Buffer size means the size of buffer and its size is 1 byte.
3. CRC data calculated from the previous data (command code + buffer size + buffer). It used to check the correctness of command and its size is 4 byte.
```
+--------------+-------------+--------+----------+
| command code | buffer size | buffer | CRC data |
+--------------+-------------+--------+----------+
```

#### Erase memory command format
The following picture shows the command format of memory erasing.
1. Buffer is composed of a combination of "page number" and "number of page".
2. Both of "page number" and "number of page" are 1 byte. That is, buffer size is 2.
```
+--------------+-------------+-------------+----------------+----------+
| command code | buffer size | page number | number of page | CRC data |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+----------------+----------+
```

## Bootloader commands
The following shows all commands provided by `cm4-bootloader`. It refers to [USART protocol used in the STM32 bootloader](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/an3155-usart-protocol-used-in-the-stm32-bootloader-stmicroelectronics.pdf).

| command              | code | description |
| -------------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| BL_GET_CMD           | 0x00 | Get the version and the allowed commands supported by the current version of the protocol |
| BL_GET_VERSION       | 0x01 | Get the protocol version |
| BL_GET_ID            | 0x02 | Get the chip ID |
| BL_GET_PROTECT_LEVEL | 0x03 | Get the protection level status |
| BL_READ_MEM          | 0x11 | Read up to 256 bytes of memory starting from an address specified by the application |
| BL_JUMP_TO_APP       | 0x21 | Jump to user application code located in the internal flash memory or in the SRAM |
| BL_WRITE_MEM         | 0x31 | Write up to 256 bytes to the RAM or flash memory starting from an address specified by the application |
| BL_ERASE_MEM         | 0x43 | Erase from one to all the flash memory pages |
| BL_ERASE_MEM_EXT     | 0x44 | Erase from one to all the flash memory pages using two-byte addressing mode |
| BL_SPECIAL           | 0x50 | Generic command that allows to add new features depending on the product constraints, without adding a new command for every feature |
| BL_SPECIAL_EXT       | 0x51 | Generic command that allows the user to send more data compared to the Special command |
| BL_WRITE_PROTECT     | 0x63 | Enable the write protection for some sectors |
| BL_WRITE_UNPROTECT   | 0x73 | Disable the write protection for all flash memory sectors |
| BL_READ_PROTECT      | 0x82 | Enable the read protection |
| BL_READ_UNPROTECT    | 0x92 | Disable the read protection |
| BL_GET_CHECKSUM      | 0xA1 | Compute a CRC value on a given memory area with a size multiple of 4 bytes |

However, there are still some commands that have not been implemented yet.
